In order to compile this application you need the following packages:

g++
make
libpcre
libmysqlclient
libevent
flex
bison
libpq

For Ubuntu and Debian I had to install:

libmysqlclient15-dev
libevent-dev
libpcre3-dev
libpcre3
libpq-dev
make
g++
gcc

For example in Debian Oldstable you will need:
libpcre3
libpcre3-dev
libevent1
libevent-dev
libmysqlclient14
libmysqlclient14-dev
libpq-dev
make

In order to build deb package you will need the folowing:
sudo apt-get install gcc g++
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install devscripts
sudo apt-get install fakeroot
sudo apt-get install debhelper
sudo apt-get install build-essential
sudo apt-get install flex
sudo apt-get install bison
sudo apt-get install libevent-dev
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient15-dev
sudo apt-get install libpcre3
sudo apt-get install libpcre3-dev
sudo apt-get install libpq-dev

For OpenSuse you need to run the following commands that will install missing packages:
yast -i flex bison gcc gcc-c++ make
yast -i postgresql-devel libmysqlclient-devel
yast -i pcre-devel libevent-devel

If you use default installation of FreeBSD you will need to install the following packages:

pkg_add -r bison
pkg_add -r libevent
pkg_add -r pcre
pkg_add -r mysql51-client
