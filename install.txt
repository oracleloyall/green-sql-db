GreenSQL Database Firewall Installation

For installation you have a number of options:
1. Download installation package for your favorite distribution 
   from the following url and install it:
   http://www.greensql.net/download
2. Build your own installation package.
3. Manual installation: compile & install from source.


Building your own installation package
--------------------------------------
If you distribution is not listed in the project download page, you
can try to build a package for your operation system. We have build a
special script that takes all steps required to build package for
popular operating systems. It automatically builds deb/rpm/bsd packages.

Before proceeding with the instalation you need to download source
code of the greensql firewall. Download it from the project download 
page: http://www.greensql.net/download

Run the following commands:

  shell> tar -xzvf greensql-fw-X.X.X.tar.gz
  shell> cd greensql-fw
  shell> ./build.sh

Last script - build.sh will create package for your OS. After installing
newly created package you need to install GreenSQL configuration db stored
in MySQL. You can do it by running the following shell script:

  shell> greensql-create-db.sh

Next step is to start the application. You can simply do it by running
the following command as a root user:

  shell> /etc/init.d/greensql-fw start

For application troubleshooting check the log file:

  shell> tail -f /var/log/greensql.log

Manual Installation
-------------------
Before installing the application you need to compile it. Without going
into much details you can do it as followed:

  shell> tar -xzvf greensql-fw-X.X.X.tar.gz
  shell> cd greensql-fw
  shell> ./build.sh

There are a number of steps to perform in order to install application.
They are:

1. Create dedicated user for greensql service.
2. Creating MySQL config db and a db user.
3. Setting up configuration files.
3. Setting log file.
4. Configure start up scripts


Creating greensql system group and user
---------------------------------------

In order to create greensql group and user run the following
commands (run these commands as a root user):

  shell> groupadd greensql
  shell> useradd -M -g greensql -s /dev/null greensql

Alternatively you do the ame by execurting the following commands:
  
  shell> cd scripts/
  shell> ./setup_user.sh


Creating MySQL DB and user
--------------------------
Just run the following script: greensql-create-db.sh . It will
automatically create configuration database.

  shell> cd scripts/
  shell> ./greensql-create-db.sh

Setting up configuration files
------------------------------

You will find a number of configuration files in the ./conf/ directory.
GreenSQL start up script expects to find the configuration files in the
following directory:

  /etc/greensql/

You simply need to copy files from ./conf/* to /etc/greensql . You can do it
as followed:

  shell> mkdir -p /etc/greensql
  shell> cp ./conf/* /etc/greensql/ -r
  shell> chown greensql:greensql /etc/greensql -R
  shell> chmod 700 /etc/greensql

Alternativly you can run setup_conf.sh file located in the scripts 
directory.

  shell> cd scripts/
  shell> ./setup_conf.sh

Next step is to alter /etc/greensql/greensql.conf file and specify correct 
db name, server, port, user and password.


Setting log file
----------------

By default greensql expects to find log file in:

/var/log/greensql.log

In addition, log file rotation must be enabled. You can do it by running
the following commands:

  shell> touch /var/log/greensql.log
  shell> chown greensql:greensql /var/log/greensql.log
  shell> chmod 600 /var/log/greensql.log
  shell> cp scripts/greensql.rotate /etc/logrotate.d/greensql

Alternatively you can run ./setup_log.sh script located in the scripts/
directory.


Configure start up scripts
--------------------------

As a final step you need to copy greensql-fw binary to the /user/sbin/
or /sbin directory and copy greensql service initialization script to the 
/etc/init.d/ directory.

Run the following commands:
 
  shell> cp greensql-fw /usr/sbin/
  shell> cp scripts/rc.greensql /etc/init.d/greensql

Another alternative is to run ./setup_binary.sh script located in the scripts/
directory.


After that you can start the application by running the following command:

  shell> /etc/init.d/greensql start

In order to stop the application use the following command:

  shell> /etc/init.d/greensql stop

For application troubleshooting check the log file:

  shell> tail -f /var/log/greensql.log
